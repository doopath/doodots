## Dependencies
See the *programs.list* file. I use Arch btw, so some names of the programs may be not correct for you. See a wiki of your distro.

**Something do not want to work:**
**If your use my configuration and you have some troubles with it:**
  * check if you haven't install something (90% of cases)
  * some package in your system has other name (like python-dev in debian and python in Arch)
  * config file use not your hardware name module (for example: my net-interface is called wlp2s0, but your one could be other)

**Just use google to find answer for your question.**
