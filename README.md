##Here you can find my dotfiles
**Location:**
.zsh, .zshrc, .gtk-2.0, .doom.d located at home directory, other at ~/.config/

**Something do not want to work:**
+If your use my configuration and you have some troubles with it:
  *check if you haven't install something (99% of cases)
  *some package in your system has other name (like python-dev in debian and python in arch)
  *config file use not your hardware name module (for example: my net-interface named wlp2s0, but your could be other)

Just use google to find answer to your question.
